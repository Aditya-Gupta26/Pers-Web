            <h3>Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India</h3>
            <p>Hi! Aditya here. <br><br> I am an avid learner, a passionate researcher and a philomath. I have deep passion for AI/ML, data structures, mathematical optimizations and love to explore their novel use-cases. I work at Mercedes-Benz as a Research Engineer where my work is focused on the Intelligent cruise control (ICC) applications in an automobile. I've graduated from IIT Bombay with a major degree in Mechanical Engineering and a minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have been fortunate to work under the wing of notable professors at IIT Bombay as an undergraduate researcher which has nurtured my interest into research-work. My internships at financial firms has allowed me to understand the significance of efficient algorithms and their eventual impact. <br><br> In my free time, one might catch me swaying to the rhythmic beats of soulful music or grilling out in the gym. <br><br> There is always a lot of scope to learn and implement our knowledge, and I am always focused towards delivering the best quality product. </p>

                        <p>Created a novel global optimization algorithm (SwiftNav) based on probabilistic Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. It aims at obtaining the global minima for a given function over a compact domain. We utilized the Walker-Slice sampler and implemented Gibbs sampling for robust high-dimensional computations. Further, the search space for any function over the compact domain was discretized dynamically -- meaning that the grid could be refined or made coarser on the fly. Lastly, parallel processing was employed to make high-dimensional optimizations quick. </p>

                        <p>We utilized a computationally tractable algorithm (MSA Algorithm), coupled with SwiftNav which allowed us to algorithmically construct CLFs. CLFs are an important centerpiece in control engineering and in the field of Machine Learning. It can be used for multiple use-cases spanning across a diverse field like Spacecraft attitude control, Epidemic mitigation, Catalyst control, and even for biochemical reactions. We have examined these applications in detail. A bunch of polynomial and trigonometric functions were used to define the posible CLFs over the discrete space and the results were validated against the constraints specified.</p>

                        <p>We built a near-continuum soft robotic arm designed to bend at various radii of curvature along its length, offering adaptability to navigate complex scenarios. It can be used for maintenance, in healthcare and for search and rescue. We also developed a wireless remote working on Wi-Fi principle to control the essential robotic arm movements wirelessly. </p>
